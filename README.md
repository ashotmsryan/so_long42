It's my first graphical project(2D minigame) by C,

so long improved my skills in the following areas: window management,
event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.

Here I used the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.

The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level
up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.

The MiniLibX library already existed on the commputer while I was writing the code, so, it was not necessary to add
the library by hand(^_^)

THE OPTIMIZATION IS IN PROCESS...
